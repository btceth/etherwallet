  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ethereum, MyEtherWallet.com & MyEtherWallet CX, and some of the underlying Javascript libraries we use are under active development.</strong> While we have tested thoroughly & tens of thousands of wallets have been successfully created by people all over the globe, there is always the remote possibility that something unexpected happens that causes your ETH to be lost. While do everything we can to ensure that this does not happen and are available via email/reddit/twitter to assist in every way we can, this possibility still exists. Please do not invest more than you are willing to lose and please be careful. If something were to happen, we are sorry, <strong>but we are not responsible for the lost Ether.</strong></li>
    <li>MyEtherWallet.com & MyEtherWallet CX are not "web wallets". You do not create an account or give us your Ether to hold onto. All data is created on our computer/your browser, not our servers. It's not a website where you put your Ether and we store them for you. We just make it easy for you to save your wallet information in your browser/on your computer. Then we give you a place you to access that information and do stuff with it.</li>
    <li>Please, do not forget to save your private key & password when you create a new wallet. Back them up in multiple phsyical locations &ndash; not just on your computer!</li>
    <li>Please make sure you are sending to the correct address.</li>
    <li>Please reach out to us with any and all feedback you have, especially with things that confuse you or error messages that don't make sense.</li>

  <h4>0. I'm new. What do I do? </h4>
  <p> MyEtherWallet gives you the ability to generate new wallets so you can store your Ether yourself, not on an exchange. This process happens entirely on your computer, not our servers. Therefore, when you generate a new wallet, <strong> you are responsible for safely backing it up</strong>.
  <p> If you just purchased ETH on an exchange and want to hold it safely in your own wallet, or if you are using ShapeShift to exchange another from cryptocurrency, you will need to complete the following steps. These steps are outlined in detail in the questions below. Please read them all in full. </p>
  <p> Do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions. Remember, Ether now holds real monetary value and can be a significant investment. If you do not save your private key & password, there is no way to recover access to your wallet or the funds it holds.  I do not say this to scare you, only to remind you to be diligent, read carefully, and take your time during all the steps. But, if you follow the instructions found on this page, even a non-technical person can safely hold their Ether in a wallet they control. </p>

    <li> Create a new wallet. </li>

  <h4>2a. How do I save/backup my wallet?如何保存/备份钱包？</h4>
  <p> You should always back up your wallet externally - like on a flash drive, in cloud storage (Dropbox, etc), and/or a piece of paper.</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Save the address. You can keep it to yourself or share it with others. That way, others can transfer ether to you. You may know this as your account # or public key.</li>
    <li> Save a version private key. Do not show it to anyone else. Your private key is necessary when you want to access your wallet to move it, spend it, or send it! There are 4 types of private keys:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Keystore/JSON File (Encrypted · Mist/Geth Format · Recommended): </strong> This JSON file matches the keystore format used by Mist / geth so you can easily import it into those clients in the future.This is the recommended file to download and back up.</li>
      <li><strong>JSON File (unencrypted): </strong> This is the unencrypted, JSON format of your private key. Again, this means you do not need the password but anyone who finds your JSON can access your wallet and your Ether without the password. </li>
      <li><strong>Private Key (unencrypted): </strong> This is the unencrypted text version of your private key, meaning no password is necessary. If someone were to find your unencrypted private key, they could access your wallet without a password. For this reason, encrypted private keys are typically recommended.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> Place all this information in a folder, along with your JSON file, PDF version of your paper wallet, and whatever other information you would like to keep. Store it on your computer.</li>
    <li> Take this folder and place it on a USB drive. Store this USB drive in a place securely, in a separate location from your computer. Maybe that place is at your office (don't forget it when you're rich off Ether & ragequit!), at your parent's or another family member's house, in a storage locker, etc. For added security, you can encrypt that USB drive using the following guides: <a href="http://computerbeginnersguides.com/blog/2015/09/03/encrypt-a-usb-flash-drive-with-bitlocker-in-windows-10-professional-or-enterprise/" target="_blank">Windows</a> or <a href="http://www.theinstructional.com/guides/encrypt-an-external-disk-or-usb-stick-with-a-password" target="_blank">Mac</a>.</li>
    <li> Print the wallet if you have a printer. Otherwise, write down on a piece of paper your: password, address, and private key (unencrypted). Again, store this as a secure location, separate from your computer and the USB drive.</li>
    <li> Now, if your house burns down you still have a USB drive and a piece of paper. If your HDD crashes, you still have a USB drive and a piece of paper.</li>
    <li> A final reminder: You NEED the private key & password in order to access your account and Ether in the future. We do not save anything to our servers and cannot help you recover your funds if you lose your private key/JSON file and password.</li>

Don't print them because all the printers have insecure Wi-Fi these days & store stuff in memory and we're being ultra secure here. Triple check that you have written them down correctly. Store these papers in physically separate locations than the USB drives and airgapped computer.</li>
    <li>Go to the view wallet details tab and type in your private key / password from your piece of paper to ensure they are correct and access your wallet. Check that the address you wrote down is the same.</li>

  <h4>6. What happens if your site goes down? </h4>
  <p>There seems to be a lot of confusion about what MyEtherWallet does. It's not a web wallet where you put your Ether and we store them for you. You don't have a login and nothing ever gets saved to our servers. It is simply an interface that allows you to do things you normally would do via command line.</p>
  <p>If MyEtherWallet goes down, you would have to find another way (like geth or Ethereum Wallet / Mist) to do what we are doing. But you wouldn't have to "get" your ether out of MyEtherWallet because it's not in MyEtherWallet. It's in whatever wallet your generated via our site.</p>
  <p> You can import your unencrypted private key and your Geth/Mist Format (encrypted) files directly into geth / Ethereum Wallet / Mist very easily now. See question #10 below. </p>
  <p>In addition, the likelihood of us taking MyEtherWallet down is slim to none. It costs us almost nothing to maintain as we aren't storing any information. If we do take the domain down, it still is, and always will be, publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/tree/gh-pages" target="_blank">https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet</a>.

We just make it easy for you to save your wallet information in your browser/on your computer. Then we give you a place you to access that information and do stuff with it. I know it can be confusing, but when you look at the stuff in the Chrome Extension, you are NOT looking at stuff saved on our servers somewhere - it's all saved on your own computer.</p>
  <p> That said, it is <strong>very important</strong> that you back up all your information for any new wallets generated with MyEtherWallet CX externally (meaning not on your computer!). That way if anything happens to MyEtherWallet CX or your computer, you still have all the information necessary to access your Ether. See the above section for how to save your wallets externally.</p>

  <h4>7. Is using the send transaction offline?默认的发送交易方式是离线发送吗？ </h4>
  <p> No, the send transaction tab is not offline. 不是，It needs the internet in order to send Ether from one wallet to another. However, when you send a transaction, it only sends the signed transaction. Your private key safely stays with you. We also now provide an "Offline Transaction" tab so that you can ensure your private keys are on an offline/airgapped computer at all times.</p>


  <h4>8. How do I make an offline transaction?</h4>
  <ol>
    <li> Navigate to the "Offline Transaction" tab via your online computer.</li>
    <li> Enter the FROM address in the field. Please note, this is the address you are sending FROM, not TO. This generates the nonce and gas price.</li>
    <li> Move to your offline computer. Enter the TO ADDRESS and the AMOUNT you wish to send.</li>
    <li> Enter the GAS PRICE as it was displayed to you on your online computer in step #1.</li>
    <li> The GAS LIMIT has a default value of 21000. This will cover a standard transaction. If you are sending to a contract or are including additional data with your transaction, you will need to increase the gas limit. Any excess gas will be returned to you.</li>
    <li> Enter the NONCE as it was displayed to you on your online computer in step #1.</li>
    <li> If you wish, enter some data. Data is optional. If you enter data, you will need to include more than the 21000 default gas limit. All data is in HEX format.</li>
    <li> Select your wallet file -or- enter/paste your private key and unlock your wallet.</li>
    <li> Press the "GENERATE SIGNED TRANSACTION" button.</li>
    <li> The data field below this button will populate with your singed transaction. Copy this and move it back to your online computer.</li>
    <li> On your online computer, paste the signed transaction into the text field in Step 3 and click "SEND TRANSACTION". This will broadcast your transaction.</li>
  </ol>


  <h4>9. How do I send to a contract?如何向合约发送交易？</h4>
  <p> Sending to a contract often requires you to include data or additional gas or both. Previously, you had to use the "Offline Transaction" Tab in order to include data and gas with your transaction. Now, you can use the default "Send Transaction" tab to do so.</p>
  <p> Simply navigate to the "Send Transaction" tab, Select your wallet file -or- enter/paste your private key and unlock your wallet, enter a "To Address" and "Amount to Send", and then click the "Advanced Options" button below the amount field. This will display two additional fields that you can use to increase the gas above the default 21000, or add data to your transaction.</p>

  <p> You can use a blockchain explorer like 你可以使用区块浏览器，例如<a href="https://www.etherchain.org" target="_blank">etherchain.org</a> or <a href="http://etherscan.io/" target="_blank">etherscan.io</a>. Paste your address into the search bar and it will pull up your address and transaction history.将你的地址粘贴到搜索框，你将看到你的地址和交易历史。 For example, here's what our <a href="https://etherchain.org/account/0x7cb57b5a97eabe94205c07890be4c1ad31e486a8" target="_blank">donation account</a> looks like on etherchain.org.</p>


  <h4>15. Where the hell is my geth wallet file?我的Geth钱包文件在哪里？ </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Mac系统: <code>~/Library/Ethereum/keystore</code></li>
    <li>Linux系统: <code>~/.ethereum/keystore</code></li>
    <li>Windows系统: <code>%APPDATA%/Ethereum/keystore</code></li>
  </ul>


  <h4>16. Where the hell is my Mist wallet file? 我的Mist钱包文件在哪里？</h4>
  <p> Mist files are typically found in the file locations above, but it's much easier to open Mist, select "Accounts" in the top bar, select "Backup", and select "Accounts". Mist钱包文件所在位置和Geth钱包文件位置是一样的，但是更加容易找到Mist钱包文件，在Mist界面选择“账户”，选择“备份”，选择“账户”。This will open the folder where your files are stored.这样就可以打开保存钱包文件的文件夹。</p>


  <h4>17. Where is my pre-sale wallet file?我参与以太币预售获得钱包文件在哪里？</h4>
  <p> Where ever you saved it. ;) It also was emailed to you, so check there. Look for the file called <code>"ethereum_wallet_backup.json"</code> and select that file. This wallet file will be encrypted with a password that you created during the purchase of the pre-sale.</p>

    <h6> Where is this extension saving my information?</h6>
    <p>The information you store in this Chrome Extension is saved via <a href="http://chrome.storage/" target="_blank">chrome.storage</a>. - this is the same place your passwords are saved when you save your password in Chrome.</p>
    <h6> What information is saved? </h6>
    <p>The address, nickname, private key is stored in chrome.storage. The private key is encrypted using the password you set when you added the wallet. The nickname and wallet address is not encrypted.</p>
    <h6> Why aren't the nickname and wallet address encrypted?</h6>
    <p> If we were to encrypt these items, you would need to enter a password each time you wanted to view your account balance or view the nicknames. If this concerns you, we recommend you use MyEtherWallet.com instead of this Chrome Extension.</p>

  <h4>Security </h4>
  <p> One of your first questions is, "Why should I trust these people?" You are probably worried that this site isn't secure. That is a good thing. When dealing with currency and the internet, you should be paranoid. But, let's try to be a bit reasonable.</p>
  <p> At this point, we have not had our code audited. Apparently, it costs a fair bit of money to get code audited. If you or a team you know would be willing to help us out in the auditing department, please let us know. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3hh89n/could_someone_please_audit_ether_wallet/">Here is a reddit thread with another user asking for someone to audit us.</a> You can reach out to us in a variety of ways.</p>
  <p> Here are some things to alleviate any paranoia you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We've been up and running since August 2015. If you search for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/me/m/all_ethereum/search?q=myetherwallet&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all" target="_blank" />"myetherwallet" on reddit</a>, you can see numerous people who use us and no complaints or reports of stolen funds.</li>
    <li>We aren't going to take your money or steal your private key(s). There is no malicious code on this site. In fact the "GENERATE WALLET" and "BULK GENERATE" tabs are completely client-side. That means that all the code is executed on <strong> your computer </strong> and it is never sent to the servers or to us or anywhere else in the magical internet land.</li>
    <li> Check the URL -- This site is being served through GitHub and you can see the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/tree/gh-pages" target="_blank">https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet</a> to the domains: <a href="http://kvhnuke.github.io/etherwallet/" target="_blank">http://kvhnuke.github.io/etherwallet/</a> and <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com" target="_blank">https://www.myetherwallet.com</a> (our new domain with SSL). You can verify it's hosted at GitHub by using <a href="http://viewdns.info/dnsrecord/?domain=myetherwallet.com" target="_blank">http://viewdns.info/dnsrecord/?domain=myetherwallet.com</a> - last two A record IPs are owned by GitHub for their custom domain hosting.</li>
    <li> For generating wallets, you can download the <a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/tree/gh-pages">source code</a> by using the "DOWNLOAD ZIP" button in the aforementioned link. Then, disconnect your computer from the internet and / or move that .zip file via flash drive to an air-gapped computer. Unzip the file, open the dist folder, double-click on "index.html", and you have the exact same thing happening on your air-gapped computer. You can now generate wallets on that computer without fear that we are stealing you heart and soul and first-born child. (Obviously, the "Send Transaction" tab is not going to work without the internet. Sorry!)</li>
    <li> Do a test run and check and see what network activity is happening. The easiest way for you (yes, YOU!) to do this (if you are using Chrome) is to right click on the page and click "inspect element". Now, go to the "Network" tab. Then, generate a wallet. Any wallet, any password&mdash;this is a test, remember. You will see there is no network activity. You may see something happening that looks like data:image/gif and data:image/png. Those are the QR codes being generated...on your computer...by your computer. No bytes were transferred.</li>
    <li> Now, to be safe, move over to the "Resources" tab. Here you can see all the different elements that make up a website. That includes things like the HTML (the base of what you see on the page), images (pretty pictures! Usually in .jpg, .gif, or .png format), the CSS (the stuff that makes the HTML look so pretty), the JS (the stuff that makes the HTML do other stuff, like making QR codes show up when you press Generate), Local Storage (one way of storing things on your local machine), Cookies (yum! Another way for sites to store data on your machine), and caches (yet another way to store stuff on your machine, usually to make things go faster). If you click through Local Storage, Cookies, and Cache, you will see nothing is being stored. Nothing is being saved. Refresh the page and you are back to square one.</li>
    <li> If you do not feel comfortable using this tool, then by all means, do not use it. We created this tool as a helpful way for people to generate wallets and make transactions without needing to dive into command line / geth / etc. Again, feel free to reach out if you have concerns and we will respond as quickly as possible. Thanks! </li>
